# Customer without account

If one of your customer want to return articles from an order but doesn't have an account on your shop, the customer can't find the return link on the order details page.

For these customers, you can redirect them on a form where they will be invited to enter their order name and their email address.

If the order exists in your shop and the email address is the same used while ordering, they will be redirected to the return process.

## Address of the form

The address is the same for all your customers, and follow this template:

`https://shopify.shoprunback.com/kkwbeauty.com/return` if your shop is `https://kkwbeauty.com`.

The interface is the following:
