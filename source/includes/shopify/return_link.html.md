# Return link

If you don't want to add the return button to your website, you can also provide the return link directly to your customer (by email, live support, â€¦).

## Format of the return link

To initiate a return, the link you have to provide to your customer is :

`https://modulespf.shoprunback.com/kkwbeauty.com/orders/1234567/return/` if your shop is `https://kkwbeauty.com` and the order's identifier is `1234567`.

You can find the order's ID in the order's details page, at the end of the URL.

You must provide the order ID (created by Shopify automatically) not the order number.
