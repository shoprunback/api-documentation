ShopRunBack provides an official addon for Shopify users.

You can connect your shop to ShopRunBack by visiting this link: [https://shopify.shoprunback.com](https://shopify.shoprunback.com).

Once there, enter the URL of your own shop and accepts all the requested rights of the addon.

Then, you will be redirected to the ShopRunBack Dashboard and invited to create your account and company if not already done.


Your shop is now connected to ShopRunBack. You just have to add the return link on your order details page to redirect your customer to the return process.

If you have any question, please send an email to: tech_at_shoprunback.com
