# I have a problem

## Check what went wrong

We log most of the module's actions on your log system.

To access it, just go to your back-office, and, in the left menu, go to `Advanced parameters` > `Logs`.

All our logs have their message beginning with `[ShopRunBack]` so you can filter them easily.
