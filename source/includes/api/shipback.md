// Define the environment you want to use (Production or Sandbox)
\Shoprunback\RestClient::getClient()->useProductionEnvironment();

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------
// To create a Shipback, we must first have an Order to link the Shipback to
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Create an Address for the Customer
$address = new \Shoprunback\Elements\Address();
$address->country_code = 'US';
$address->line2 = 'Building B';
$address->state = 'California';
$address->line1 = 'One Infinite Loop';

// Create a Customer for the Order

$customer->email = 'steve@apple.com';
$customer->phone = '555-878-456';
$customer->first_name = 'Steve';

$shipback->save();
```

You can create the order and its corresponding shipback in 2 sequential API calls without parsing the first response by using your own references.

First, create the order with an _order_number_ and the items.
You don't have to push all the items in the initial order if you already know which items are going to be returned, just push them and not the others. You must provide item references if you want to avoid the parsing of the response. An item reference should be unique per order.

Second, create the corresponding shipback attached to your _order_number_ by giving the item's _reference_ and the reason of the return.

If the customer details of the shipback are not provided, the order's customer is copied and used for the shipback.


## Delete a shipback

An shipback can only be deleted if no yet registered (the customer has not completed the whole process).

### HTTP Request

`DELETE https://dashboard.shoprunback.com/api/v1/shipbacks/:shipback_id`

### Errors

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "SHIPBACK_REGISTERED",
      "message": "This shipback is already processing. You can't delete it."
    }
  ]
}
```

If you are trying to delete an arlready registered shipback, you will receive an error with a `400` HTTP CODE.

You will also have an error message and an error code in the returned JSON.

In this case, the error code will be `SHIPBACK_REGISTERED`.

If the deletion is successful, you will receive a `200` HTTP CODE.
