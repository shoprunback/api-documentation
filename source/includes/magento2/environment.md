# Environment
<aside class="warning">
Pay attention to which environment is set in your configuration!

 There are 2 modes: 
  <ul>
    <li>Sandbox: 	It is a test environment. The data on this environment is reset every monday.</li>
    <li>Production: It is where your customersâ€™ return requests are made.</li>
  </ul>

<aside class="warning">
	
This is real data! If you switch the environment, change your API token or uninstall the module, all the return requests and synchronizations will be reset!
