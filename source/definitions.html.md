# Order

An order is a set of products bought by a customer and sent in one parcel.
On ShopRunBack, multiple items from the same order (single parcel) can be returned in one <a href="#shipback">shipback</a>.

If your shop has multiple shipping locations and one order could be shipped in multiple parcels, we recommend to create one order by parcel.

# Relocation

The relocation is the last part

# Return

cf [Shipback](#shipback)

# Shipback

A shipback is a synonym of "return".
So, in the case of ShopRunBack, a shipback is all the process for returning an order: the declaration part and the logistic part.

# Sponsoring

On ShopRunBack, you can configure what your customer will pay depending of the context of the return.
So, you can sponsor the return to 100% when the return is caused by you (ex. wrong item delivered), 0% when it its fault (ex. change its mind) or any of percentage for other cases.
