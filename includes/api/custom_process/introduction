<h1 id="your-own-return-process">Your own return process</h1>

<p>If <b>you don&rsquo;t want to use the return process provided by ShopRunBack</b>, you can built your own return&rsquo;s funnel.</p>

<p>For that you have to:</p>

<p>1/ Create the shipback with the list of the returned items (with the associated reason code)</p>

<p>2/ Request the quotes (for each mode - pickup, postal and dropoff - a quote is created to compute the corresponding price of the return)</p>

<p>3/ Confirm the quote (select and confirm one of the available quotes)</p>

<p>4/ Get the label</p>

<aside class="notice">
ShopRunBack is directly connected to the system of multiple carriers with variable response time.
For that reason, several calls made to the API will provide the response <b>asynchronously</b>.

<aside class="warning">
  You can only generate the label by yourself for mode you sponsor entirely (sponsoring = 100%). Otherwise your customer has to pay for the remaining part and it can only be done on our website.
