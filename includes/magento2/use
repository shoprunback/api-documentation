<p>Any customer can create a return request once an order is at least Shipped and invoiced. Then, they have a button to create a return request on the details of the order. </p>

<p>Then, you can start to purchase a product. After completing the  order go to your return page (/shoprunback/shipback/index). 
Once you have completed your purchase, the order status is pending and the return button is not available so you cannot return the product until the admin submit invoice and shipment.</p>

<p>Once the admin is done submitting the invoice and shipment, the “Return Order” button will be available.</p>
