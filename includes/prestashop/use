<h2 id="how-to-synchronize-your-data">How to synchronize your data</h2>

<p>The ShopRunBack tab summarizes your returns, products, brands and orders, and allows you to synchronize them with ShopRunBack.</p>

<p>On each tab, you can see your data and can synchronize each of them at any time, or all at once.</p>

<p>You must always have your data synchronized with ShopRunBack to avoid any discrepancies.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-automatically-synchronized">What is automatically synchronized?</h2>

<p>For instance, some of your data is automatically synchronized after some actions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Product

<ul>
<li>When you create a product</li>
<li>When you edit a product</li>
<li>When you delete a product</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Order

<ul>
<li>When you or a customer create an order</li>
<li>When the status of an order changes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Return

<ul>
<li>When a return is modified on ShopRunBack</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<aside class="warning">
  You still need to manually synchronize the brands.
</aside>

<aside class="warning">
  If you delete a product that has already been ordered, even just once, it cannot be deleted on ShopRunBack&rsquo;s database.
</aside>

<aside class="warning">
  When you create a product on your website, you must fill the following fields:

  <ul>
    <li>Label</li>
    <li>Reference</li>
    <li>Weight</li>
  </ul>

<h2 id="how-do-my-customers-create-a-return-request">How do my customers create a return request?</h2>

<p>Any customer can create a return request once an order is at least <code class="prettyprint">Shipped</code>.</p>

<p>They then have a button to create a return request on the details of the order.</p>

<p>(The screenshots show the default PrestaShop template)</p>
